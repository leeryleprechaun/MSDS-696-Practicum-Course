    , this English brewery strain is thought to be from the historical London brewery that Louis Pasteur visited. It is a strong fermenter, brewery friendly, flexible, leaves near spotless clarity, and has more fruit-like esters and malt than British Ale I. Select for malt and fruit at higher fermentation temperatures or a clean profile at lower temperatures.
